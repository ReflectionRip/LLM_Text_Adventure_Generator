# LLM_Text_Adventure_Generator
LLM Text Adventure Generator

## Description
This is a 'Text Adventure Game' and Generator. Designed to look and feel like the old text adventure games and MUDs. A scene is described, and the player enters their action.
Behind the game is an LLM communication system currently designed to work with 'oobabooga' [https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui]. It will:
1. Take the users input, which can be natural or gamified.
2. Check it against a list of possible actions.
3. Process the action if it is a valid game action.
4. Respond to the user natually.
There are are two main modes: Game and Generator.
1. Game mode - The player can move through the game envirnment, do actions, etc.
2. Generator Mode - If a scene that isn't generated yet by an LLM is encountered a new scene will be generated.

## Goal
I have three goals for this project.
1. Learning - Develop my skills with LLM game development and python programming.
2. Gaming - Eventually have a game engine to play with.
3. Provide - A building block, and/or game for others to develop on and play with.

## Others
While developing this code I eventually thought; I wonder if anyone else is making something simular. So here is a list of other LLM Text Adventure Games. I may eventually review these others for insperation if I get stuck, but I want to try to write this entirely on my own.
If you are making your own and want me to link it here feel free make a comment with the path to the game. I will add it to this list. Or notify me if you want it removed from this list:
